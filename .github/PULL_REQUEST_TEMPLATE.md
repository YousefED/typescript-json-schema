Please:
- [ ] Do not include the compiled `.js`, `.js.map`, or `.d.ts` in your pull request as it makes it harder to merge your changes. 
- [ ] Make your pull request atomic, fixing one issue at a time unless there are many relevant issues that cannot be decoupled.
- [ ] Provide a test case & update the documentation in the `README.md`
